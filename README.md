## The Mission
Farmers often lose crops to disease due to late diagnosis or incorrect spraying (e.g., spraying before rain). AgriVision Pro solves this by combining computer vision with real-time environmental context. It doesn't just "see" the plant; it "thinks" about the best course of action.

## Key Features
* **Agentic Reasoning:** The AI identifies the disease and immediately checks live weather to determine if spraying is safe.
* **Multimodal Input:** Supports live camera scanning and high-res image uploads for precise lesion detection.
* **Real-Time Market Search:** Uses Gemini's **Google Search Tool** to find exact medicines, current prices, and buying links in Pakistan.

## Tech Stack
* **Core AI:** Google Gemini 3 (Multimodal)
* **Framework:** Streamlit
* **Tools:** Google Search Grounding, OpenWeatherMap API

### Hackathon Context
